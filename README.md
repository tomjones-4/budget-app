# budget-app

This app will allow users to keep track of how much money they're spending and set limits.

Goals:
* Start by having app available on CLI
* Eventually there should be a GUI where user can interact with some simple controls to get the data they want
*   Ex: Set limits, see what % of monthly limit they've spent, see how much they spent in time range, etc.
* Get app working with test data
* Eventually make it so app can read data from credit card statement
*   This should work for my credit cards, at least
*   Ideally, individual users of app can authenticate themselves and get their own cc data
* Reading data from Venmo would be a nice addition

Stretch goals:
* This might be a big enough idea to be its own project entirely, but it would be cool to have analytics performed on the cc data and credit cards recommended based on spending habits
* This would involve analyzing data about credit cards (such as APR, sign-up fees, percentages back, points, etc.) from online and making a recommendation. This could be a good opportunity to try using some machine learning or predictive analytics.
